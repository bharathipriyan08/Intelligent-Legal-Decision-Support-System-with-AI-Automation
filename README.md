# Intelligent-Legal-Decision-Support-System-with-AI-Automation
The Intelligent Legal Decision Support System with AI Automation is a technology-driven solution that leverages artificial intelligence to assist legal professionals in decision-making. It automates legal research, case analysis, and document processing, providing data-driven insights and predictive analytics to improve accuracy and efficiency in legal proceedings

# About
This project addresses this need by introducing an AI-Based Preliminary Legal Advice System. The system leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies to interpret user queries written in natural language and match them with relevant laws, case studies, and legal documents. The system’s primary objective is to ensure users receive accurate and contextually appropriate legal advice, even without direct consultation with a legal professional. This AI-driven solution enhances accessibility to legal information, offering individuals the ability to understand their rights and obligations and make informed decisions based on preliminary advice.
